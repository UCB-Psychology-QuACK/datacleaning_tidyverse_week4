# Practice
# Authors: Willa & Elena

#### Set options ####
# Set your stringAsFactors option to false!
# I always do this at the top of all of my scripts.


#### 1. Check/Set your working directory ####
# Make sure you are where you want to be.


#### 2. Load your data ####
# Data adapted from Allison Horst and her Palmer Penguins
# https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins
# Load in penguin.csv



#### 3. Check for missing values ####

# i. Are there any missing values? (There are a few ways you can check for this.)



# ii. Remove those penguins!




##### 4. Get to know some of these penguins ##### 

# i. Pull the all available info for penguin p5



# ii. How much does penguin p18 weigh? 



# iii. Who is heavier p18 or p38?




#### 5. On average, do Adelie or Gentoo penguins have longer bill length? ####




#### 6. Subsetting data ####
# In the following exerices, subset penguins using both bracket notation and the subset function
# i. Make a data frame of all the penguins that weigh more than p18



# ii. Make new data frames, one for each island. 




# iii. Make a new data frame of all the Adelie penguins on Dream island.



# iv. Do the same as in iii, but now only select the species, island, bill_length_mm, and sex columns for your new data frame



#### 7. Challenge: What island has the most Adelie species ####
# Hint: Use table() function
